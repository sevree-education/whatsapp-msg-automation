# This script uses the 'pywhatkit' library to automate sending a single message
# to multiple WhatsApp numbers through the WhatsApp Web interface.
#
# PREREQUISITE:
# 1. You must have the 'pywhatkit' library installed: pip install pywhatkit
# 2. You must have WhatsApp Web logged in on your default web browser.
# 3. The script will wait 20 seconds for the WhatsApp Web page to load before attempting to send the message.

    NOTE: The script requires the phone numbers to be in international format
    (e.g., '+11234567890') and will open a new browser tab for each message.
    The message sending is timed (currently set to 20 seconds from execution).
